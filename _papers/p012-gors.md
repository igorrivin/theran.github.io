title: Generic Global and Universal Rigidity
year: 2016
---

We show that any graph that is generically globally rigid in $$\mathbb{R}^d$$ has a realization in $$\mathbb{R}^d$$ that 
is both generic and universally rigid. It also must have a realization in $$\mathbb{R}^d$$ that is both infinitesimally 
rigid and universally rigid. Such a realization serves as a certificate of generic global rigidity. Previous 
certificates for generic global rigidity, even though they did involve calculations for 
particular configurations, did not necessarily guarantee that those configurations were globally rigid. 

Our approach involves an algorithm by Lov√°sz, Saks and Schrijver that constructs a general position 
orthogonal representation of the vertices, when the graph is vertex (d+1)-connected, and a result of 
Alfakih that shows how this representation leads to a stress matrix and a universally rigid framework of the graph.
