I am a Lecturer in Mathematics at St Andrews. 

I like to work on problems that feature an interaction between geometry, combinatorics,
and algorithmic considerations. I also like theoretical problems that arise out of
concrete, applied scenarios.

My main projects right now center around:

- The rigidity and flexibility of frameworks
- Algebraic and combinatorial approaches to machine learning and data analysis
